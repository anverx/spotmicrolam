Design goals of the project:
* Sheap, under 500e, ideally towards 300e
* Off the shelf components and 3D printed parts only
* bldc motors

Challenges:
At the moment the biggest challenge are the motor drivers.  There are plenty of cheap brushless motors for aircrafts, and they should work fine.  
The ESC however are geared towards flying, they offer no reverse rotation or holding torque.  Finding the right ESCs and controlling them is an interesing excersize.
